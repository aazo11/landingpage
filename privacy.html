This Policy does not govern how information is used by parties that we do not control or by individuals who we do not employ. If you visit a website or app that we mention or link to, be sure to review their privacy policy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Personally Identifiable Information</span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c3">There are limited pieces of information that we collect from you that is &quot;Personally Identifiable Information,&quot; or &quot;PII&quot;. These are your name, home address, your email address, your telephone number(s), your picture if you upload it directly to the Platform, your unique mobile device ID number, and your social media account IDs. We take our collection of PII and your privacy expectations very seriously, and therefore have very restrictive rules for handling, using, and sharing this information, as described in this Policy. It is up to you whether to disclose PII to us, although if you do not do so, certain products and services may not be available for your use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c14">Information that you post to </span><span class="c4 c8">HiGeorge</span></p><p class="c7"><span>There are many functions and areas of our website and applications where you can post information about yourself, your views, and your affiliations. It is important to remember that some of these areas are publicly viewable to other users and organizations. </span><span class="c8">HiGeorge</span><span>&nbsp;does not control which information you post to publicly viewable areas. For instance, we enable you to create campaigns. I</span><span class="c8">f you create a campaign that uses your real name (as opposed to a username), or add your contact information to the campaign, then anyone with access to HiGeorge will be able to see that information. </span><span>Similarly, sharing actions that you take on </span><span class="c8">HiGeorge</span><span>&nbsp;via your social networks will enable access to that information to third parties in a manner that we cannot control. It is important to distinguish your provision of PII to us directly, which we can control under this Policy, from the information you post publicly or provide to other people, organizations, or via other services, which </span><span class="c8">HiGeorge</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;cannot control.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c4"></span></p><p class="c7"><span>In addition to PII, there is other information that you may share through </span><span class="c8">HiGeorge</span><span>&nbsp;that we consider sensitive and to which we apply strict rules. While this information cannot be used to identify you personally, it does provide insights about the views of people who use </span><span class="c8">HiGeorge</span><span class="c3">. We refer to this information in this Policy as your Civic Actions, which includes the campaigns you have supported and created.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c7"><span class="c4">Anonymous information</span></p><p class="c7"><span>We also collect information about the use of the </span><span class="c8">HiGeorge </span><span class="c3">platform which does not reveal your identity.

In doing so, we may use your PII and your Civic Actions to draw your attention to issues in which we believe you may be interested, and to communicate directly with you through email, our apps, </span><span>or in your usage of our services</span><span class="c3">.
